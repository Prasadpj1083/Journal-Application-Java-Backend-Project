# Journal-Application-Java-Backend-Project

📓 Journal Application – Java Backend Project
A fully functional journal management application built using modern Java backend technologies. This project demonstrates my expertise in RESTful API design, CRUD operations, MongoDB Atlas integration, Apache Kafka for messaging, and code quality assurance with SonarQube.

🚀 Key Features
✅ CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete journal entries using well-structured REST APIs.

🌐 Spring Boot Framework: Robust and scalable Java backend structure.

☁️ MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based NoSQL database integration for seamless data storage.

📬 Apache Kafka Integration:

Real-time communication for events like entry creation and updates.

Kafka producers and consumers implemented for asynchronous data handling.

📘 Validation and Annotations: Used Spring annotations like @RequestMapping, @Valid, @Entity, @RestController, etc., ensuring clean and maintainable code.

🛡️ Exception Handling: Custom exception handling with proper HTTP status codes and user-friendly error messages.

🔍 SonarQube Integration:

Analyzed codebase for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

Ensures high code quality and industry-standard practices.

🔐 Security (Optional): Token-based authentication (JWT) or Spring Security (if implemented).

🌐 Hosted on MongoDB Atlas: For real-time cloud data persistence and easy scalability.
